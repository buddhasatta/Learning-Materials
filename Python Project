To build your portfolio and gain practical skills, here are some project ideas in Python, categorized by skill level.

### üê£ Basic Projects

These projects focus on building foundational programming skills like **data types**, **control flow**, **functions**, and **basic input/output**. They are a great starting point for beginners.

* **To-Do List Application:** Create a simple command-line or GUI application where users can add, view, and remove tasks. This teaches you how to handle user input, store data (e.g., in a list or a simple file), and create an interactive loop.
* **Dice Rolling Simulator:** A fun project to practice using the `random` module. The program asks the user if they want to roll the dice, and if they do, it generates a random number between 1 and 6. This is perfect for learning about loops and random number generation.
* **Password Generator:** Build a script that generates a random, secure password of a specified length and complexity (e.g., including uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols). This introduces you to string manipulation and the `random` module.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Intermediate Projects

These projects move beyond the basics, requiring you to work with external libraries, APIs, and more complex logic. They are ideal for strengthening your problem-solving skills and building something more substantial.

* **Web Scraper:** Use libraries like **Beautiful Soup** or **Scrapy** to extract data from websites. For example, you could scrape real estate listings, sports scores, or product prices from an e-commerce site. This is a fundamental skill for data professionals.
* **Sentiment Analysis of Social Media:** Fetch data from a social media API (like Twitter's) and use an NLP library such as **TextBlob** or **spaCy** to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets. This introduces you to **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.
* **Simple Flask/Django Web Application:** Build a basic web app like a blog, a personal portfolio, or a simple e-commerce site. Using a framework like **Flask** or **Django** will teach you about **web development**, **databases** (e.g., SQLite), and **HTTP requests**.

### üöÄ Advanced Projects

Advanced projects involve complex algorithms, large datasets, and deploying a full system. They're excellent for a portfolio to showcase your expertise in a specific domain.

* **Real-Time Data Pipeline:** Construct a pipeline that ingests data from a streaming source (like an API), processes it in real time, and stores it in a database. This project can use tools like **Apache Kafka** for streaming and **Apache Spark** for processing.
* **Credit Card Fraud Detection:** Use a large, public dataset of credit card transactions to build a machine learning model that classifies transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. This project involves **handling imbalanced datasets**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation**.
* **Image Classifier with Deep Learning:** Build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from a dataset like **MNIST** (handwritten digits) or **CIFAR-10** (common objects). You can use frameworks like **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** to create, train, and evaluate the model. This is a crucial project for anyone interested in computer vision.
